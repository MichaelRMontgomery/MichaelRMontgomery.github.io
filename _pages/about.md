 I am a researcher in operator algebras with interests in mathematical physics, quantum topology, quantum information theory, and their applications. I mainly employ tools from subfactor theory, tensor categories, and reproducing kernel function spaces. I completed my PhD in mathematics at Vanderbilt University, advised by Dietmar Bisch where I worked on Hadamard matrices and the standard invariants of the hyperfinte subfactors they generate. Currently, I am working as a postdoc with Dimitrios Giannakis at Dartmouth college. We are exploring schemes to approximate classical dynamical systems on quantum computers.

 Outside of work I am primarily a father and husband. In my free time I enjoy the outdoors, hiking, mountain biking and kayaking. I am also a <a href="https://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/pdb-search.cgi?act=inv&key=1255"> puzzle designer</a> and pianist.
